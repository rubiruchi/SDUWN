ovn-controller \- Open Virtual Network local controller
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIovs-database\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR is the local controller daemon for OVN, the Open Virtual Network\[char46] It connects up to the OVN Southbound database (see \fBovn\-sb\fR(5)) over the OVSDB protocol, and down to the Open vSwitch database (see \fBovs\-vswitchd\[char46]conf\[char46]db\fR(5)) over the OVSDB protocol and to \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) via OpenFlow\[char46] Each hypervisor and software gateway in an OVN deployment runs its own independent copy of \fBovn\-controller\fR; thus, \fBovn\-controller\fR\(cqs downward connections are machine-local and do not run over a physical network\[char46]
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR retrieves most of its configuration information from the local Open vSwitch\(cqs ovsdb-server instance\[char46] The default location is \fBdb\[char46]sock\fR in the local Open vSwitch\(cqs \(dqrun\(dq directory\[char46] It may be overridden by specifying the \fIovs-database\fR argument in one of the following forms:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBssl:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
The specified SSL \fIport\fR on the host at the given \fIip\fR, which must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4 or IPv6 address format\[char46] If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]: \fBssl:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46] The \fB\-\-private\-key\fR, \fB\-\-certificate\fR and either of \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR or \fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert\fR options are mandatory when this form is used\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBtcp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
Connect to the given TCP \fIport\fR on \fIip\fR, where \fIip\fR can be IPv4 or IPv6 address\[char46] If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]: \fBtcp:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fB\fR
.IP
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named \fIfile\fR\[char46]
.IP
On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port whose value is written in \fIfile\fR\[char46]

.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR assumes it gets configuration information from the following keys in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table of the local OVS instance:
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:system\-id\fR
The chassis name to use in the Chassis table\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:hostname\fR
The hostname to use in the Chassis table\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\fR
The integration bridge to which logical ports are attached\[char46] The default is \fBbr\-int\fR\[char46] If this bridge does not exist when ovn-controller starts, it will be created automatically with the default configuration suggested in \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7)\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-remote\fR
The OVN database that this system should connect to for its configuration, in one of the same forms documented above for the \fIovs-database\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-remote\-probe\-interval\fR
The inactivity probe interval of the connection to the OVN database, in milliseconds\[char46] If the value is zero, it disables the connection keepalive feature\[char46]
.IP
If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at least 1000 ms\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-type\fR
The encapsulation type that a chassis should use to connect to this node\[char46] Multiple encapsulation types may be specified with a comma-separated list\[char46] Each listed encapsulation type will be paired with \fBovn\-encap\-ip\fR\[char46]
.IP
Supported tunnel types for connecting hypervisors are \fBgeneve\fR and \fBstt\fR\[char46] Gateways may use \fBgeneve\fR, \fBvxlan\fR, or \fBstt\fR\[char46]
.IP
Due to the limited amount of metadata in \fBvxlan\fR, the capabilities and performance of connected gateways will be reduced versus other tunnel formats\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-ip\fR
The IP address that a chassis should use to connect to this node using encapsulation types specified by \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-type\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR
A list of key-value pairs that map a physical network name to a local ovs bridge that provides connectivity to that network\[char46] An example value mapping two physical network names to two ovs bridges would be: \fBphysnet1:br\-eth0,physnet2:br\-eth1\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-csum\fR
\fBovn\-encap\-csum\fR indicates that encapsulation checksums can be transmitted and received with reasonable performance\[char46] It is a hint to senders transmitting data to this chassis that they should use checksums to protect OVN metadata\[char46] Set to \fBtrue\fR to enable or \fBfalse\fR to disable\[char46] Depending on the capabilities of the network interface card, enabling encapsulation checksum may incur performance loss\[char46] In such cases, encapsulation checksums can be disabled\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR reads the following values from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR database of the local OVS instance:
.RS
.TP
\fBdatapath\-type\fR from \fBBridge\fR table
This value is read from local OVS integration bridge row of \fBBridge\fR table and populated in \fBexternal_ids:datapath-type\fR of the \fBChassis\fR table in the OVN_Southbound database\[char46]
.TP
\fBiface\-types\fR from \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table
This value is populated in \fBexternal_ids:iface-types\fR of the \fBChassis\fR table in the OVN_Southbound database\[char46]
.RE
.SH "OPEN VSWITCH DATABASE USAGE"
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR uses a number of \fBexternal_ids\fR keys in the Open vSwitch database to keep track of ports and interfaces\[char46] For proper operation, users should not change or clear these keys:
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-chassis\-id\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
The presence of this key identifies a tunnel port within the integration bridge as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to reach a remote chassis\[char46] Its value is the chassis ID of the remote chassis\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ct\-zone\-*\fR in the \fBBridge\fR table
Logical ports and gateway routers are assigned a connection tracking zone by \fBovn\-controller\fR for stateful services\[char46] To keep state across restarts of \fBovn\-controller\fR, these keys are stored in the integration bridge\(cqs Bridge table\[char46] The name contains a prefix of \fBct\-zone\-\fR followed by the name of the logical port or gateway router\(cqs zone key\[char46] The value for this key identifies the zone used for this port\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-localnet\-port\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
The presence of this key identifies a patch port as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to connect the integration bridge and another bridge to implement a \fBlocalnet\fR logical port\[char46] Its value is the name of the logical port with \fBtype\fR set to \fBlocalnet\fR that the port implements\[char46] See \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR, above, for more information\[char46]
.IP
Each \fBlocalnet\fR logical port is implemented as a pair of patch ports, one in the integration bridge, one in a different bridge, with the same \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-localnet\-port\fR value\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-l2gateway\-port\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
The presence of this key identifies a patch port as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to connect the integration bridge and another bridge to implement a \fBl2gateway\fR logical port\[char46] Its value is the name of the logical port with \fBtype\fR set to \fBl2gateway\fR that the port implements\[char46] See \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR, above, for more information\[char46]
.IP
Each \fBl2gateway\fR logical port is implemented as a pair of patch ports, one in the integration bridge, one in a different bridge, with the same \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-l2gateway\-port\fR value\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal\-ids:ovn\-l3gateway\-port\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
This key identifies a patch port as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to implement a \fBl3gateway\fR logical port\[char46] Its value is the name of the logical port with type set to \fBl3gateway\fR\[char46] This patch port is similar to the OVN logical patch port, except that \fBl3gateway\fR port can only be bound to a paticular chassis\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal\-ids:ovn\-logical\-patch\-port\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
This key identifies a patch port as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to implement an OVN logical patch port within the integration bridge\[char46] Its value is the name of the OVN logical patch port that it implements\[char46]

\fBovs\-appctl\fR can send commands to a running \fBovn\-controller\fR process\[char46] The currently supported commands are described below\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Causes \fBovn\-controller\fR to gracefully terminate\[char46]
.TP
\fBct\-zone\-list\fR

\fBinject\-pkt\fR \fImicroflow\fR
Injects \fImicroflow\fR into the connected Open vSwitch instance\[char46] \fImicroflow\fR must contain an ingress logical port (\fBinport\fR argument) that is present on the Open vSwitch instance\[char46]
.IP
The \fImicroflow\fR argument describes the packet whose forwarding is to be simulated, in the syntax of an OVN logical expression, as described in \fBovn\-sb\fR(5), to express constraints\[char46] The parser understands prerequisites; for example, if the expression refers to \fBip4\[char46]src\fR, there is no need to explicitly state \fBip4\fR or \fBeth\[char46]type ==
0x800\fR\[char46]
