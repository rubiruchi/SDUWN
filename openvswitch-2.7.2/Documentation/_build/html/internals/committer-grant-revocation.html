<h1>OVS Committer Grant/Revocation Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#ovs-committer-grant-revocation-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An OVS committer is a participant in the project with the ability to commit
code directly to the master repository. Commit access grants a broad ability to
affect the progress of the project as presented by its most important artifact,
the code and related resources that produce working binaries of Open vSwitch.
As such it represents a significant level of trust in an individual&#8217;s
commitment to working with other committers and the community at large for the
benefit of the project. It can not be granted lightly and, in the worst case,
must be revocable if the trust placed in an individual was inappropriate.</p>
<p>This document suggests guidelines for granting and revoking commit access. It
is intended to provide a framework for evaluation of such decisions without
specifying deterministic rules that wouldn&#8217;t be sensitive to the nuance of
specific situations. In the end the decision to grant or revoke committer
privileges is a judgment call made by the existing set of committers.</p>
<div class="section" id="granting-commit-access">
<h2>Granting Commit Access<a class="headerlink" href="#granting-commit-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Granting commit access should be considered when a candidate has demonstrated
the following in their interaction with the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Contribution of significant new features through the patch submission
process where:<ul>
<li>Submissions are free of obvious critical defects</li>
<li>Submissions do not typically require many iterations of improvement
to be accepted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistent participation in code review of other&#8217;s patches, including
existing committers, with comments consistent with the overall project
standards</li>
<li>Assistance to those in the community who are less knowledgeable through
active participation in project forums such as the ovs-discuss mailing list.</li>
<li>Plans for sustained contribution to the project compatible with the project&#8217;s
direction as viewed by current committers.</li>
<li>Commitment to meet the expectations described in the &#8220;Expectations of
Developer&#8217;s with Open vSwitch Access&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The process to grant commit access to a candidate is simple:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An existing committer nominates the candidate by sending an email to all
existing committers with information substantiating the contributions of the
candidate in the areas described above.</li>
<li>All existing committers discuss the pros and cons of granting commit
access to the candidate in the email thread.</li>
<li>When the discussion has converged or a reasonable time has elapsed without
discussion developing (e.g. a few business days) the nominator calls for a
final decision on the candidate with a followup email to the thread.</li>
<li>Each committer may vote yes, no, or abstain by replying to the email thread.
A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.</li>
<li>After votes from all existing committers have been collected or a reasonable
time has elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days) the
votes are evaluated. To be granted commit access the candidate must receive
yes votes from a majority of the existing committers and zero no votes. Since
a no vote is effectively a veto of the candidate it should be accompanied by
a reason for the vote.</li>
<li>The nominator summarizes the result of the vote in an email to all existing
committers.</li>
<li>If the vote to grant commit access passed, the candidate is contacted with an
invitation to become a committer to the project which asks them to agree to
the committer expectations documented on the project web site.</li>
<li>If the candidate agrees access is granted by setting up commit access to the
repos on github.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="revoking-commit-access">
<h2>Revoking Commit Access<a class="headerlink" href="#revoking-commit-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two situations in which commit access might be revoked.</p>
<p>The straightforward situation is a committer who is no longer active in the
project and has no plans to become active in the near future. The process in
this case is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any time after a committer has been inactive for more than 6 months any other
committer to the project may identify that committer as a candidate for
revocation of commit access due to inactivity.</li>
<li>The plans of revocation should be sent in a private email to the candidate.</li>
<li>If the candidate for removal states plans to continue participating no action
is taken and this process terminates.</li>
<li>If the candidate replies they no longer require commit access then commit
access is removed and a notification is sent to the candidate and all
existing committers.</li>
<li>If the candidate can not be reached within 1 week of the first attempting to
contact this process continues.</li>
<li>A message proposing removal of commit access is sent to the candidate and all
other committers.<ul>
<li>If the candidate for removal states plans to continue participating no
action is taken.</li>
<li>If the candidate replies they no longer require commit access then their
access is removed.</li>
<li>If the candidate can not be reached within 2 months of the second
attempting to contact them, access is removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In any case, where access is removed, this fact is published through an email
to all existing committers (including the candidate for removal).</li>
</ul>
<p>The more difficult situation is a committer who is behaving in a manner that is
viewed as detrimental to the future of the project by other committers. This is
a delicate situation with the potential for the creation of division within the
greater community and should be handled with care. The process in this case is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Discuss the behavior of concern with the individual privately and explain why
you believe it is detrimental to the project. Stick to the facts and keep the
email professional. Avoid personal attacks and the temptation to hypothesize
about unknowable information such as the other&#8217;s motivations. Make it clear
that you would prefer not to discuss the behavior more widely but will have
to raise it with other contributors if it does not change. Ideally the
behavior is eliminated and no further action is required. If not,</li>
<li>Start an email thread with all committers, including the source of the
behavior, describing the behavior and the reason it is detrimental to the
project. The message should have the same tone as the private discussion and
should generally repeat the same points covered in that discussion. The
person whose behavior is being questioned should not be surprised by anything
presented in this discussion. Ideally the wider discussion provides more
perspective to all participants and the issue is resolved. If not,</li>
<li>Start an email thread with all committers except the source of the
detrimental behavior requesting a vote on revocation of commit
rights. Cite the discussion among all committers and describe all the
reasons why it was not resolved satisfactorily. This email should be
carefully written with the knowledge that the reasoning it contains
may be published to the larger community to justify the decision.</li>
<li>Each committer may vote yes, no, or abstain by replying to the email
thread. A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.</li>
<li>After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has elapsed
for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days) the votes
are evaluated. For the request to revoke commit access for the
candidate to pass it must receive yes votes from two thirds of the
existing committers.</li>
<li>anyone that votes no must provide their reasoning, and</li>
<li>if the proposal passes then counter-arguments for the reasoning in no
votes should also be documented along with the initial reasons the
revocation was proposed. Ideally there should be no new
counter-arguments supplied in a no vote as all concerns should have
surfaced in the discussion before the vote.</li>
<li>The original person to propose revocation summarizes the result of
the vote in an email to all existing committers excepting the
candidate for removal.</li>
<li>If the vote to revoke commit access passes, access is removed and the
candidate for revocation is informed of that fact and the reasons for
it as documented in the email requesting the revocation vote.</li>
<li>Ideally the revoked committer peacefully leaves the community and no
further action is required. However, there is a distinct possibility
that he/she will try to generate support for his/her point of view
within the larger community. In this case the reasoning for removing
commit access as described in the request for a vote will be
published to the community.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="changing-the-policy">
<h2>Changing the Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process for changing the policy is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Propose the changes to the policy in an email to all current committers and
request discussion.</li>
<li>After an appropriate period of discussion (a few days) update the proposal
based on feedback if required and resend it to all current committers with a
request for a formal vote.</li>
<li>After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has elapsed for them
to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days) the votes are evaluated. For
the request to modify the policy to pass it must receive yes votes from two
thirds of the existing committers.</li>
