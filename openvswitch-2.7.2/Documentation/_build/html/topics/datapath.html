<h1>Open vSwitch Datapath Development Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#open-vswitch-datapath-development-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Open vSwitch kernel module allows flexible userspace control over
flow-level packet processing on selected network devices.  It can be used to
implement a plain Ethernet switch, network device bonding, VLAN processing,
network access control, flow-based network control, and so on.</p>
<p>The kernel module implements multiple &#8220;datapaths&#8221; (analogous to bridges), each
of which can have multiple &#8220;vports&#8221; (analogous to ports within a bridge).  Each
datapath also has associated with it a &#8220;flow table&#8221; that userspace populates
with &#8220;flows&#8221; that map from keys based on packet headers and metadata to sets of
actions.  The most common action forwards the packet to another vport; other
actions are also implemented.</p>
<p>When a packet arrives on a vport, the kernel module processes it by extracting
its flow key and looking it up in the flow table.  If there is a matching flow,
it executes the associated actions.  If there is no match, it queues the packet
to userspace for processing (as part of its processing, userspace will likely
set up a flow to handle further packets of the same type entirely in-kernel).</p>
<div class="section" id="flow-key-compatibility">
<h2>Flow Key Compatibility<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-key-compatibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Network protocols evolve over time.  New protocols become important and
existing protocols lose their prominence.  For the Open vSwitch kernel module
to remain relevant, it must be possible for newer versions to parse additional
protocols as part of the flow key.  It might even be desirable, someday, to
drop support for parsing protocols that have become obsolete.  Therefore, the
Netlink interface to Open vSwitch is designed to allow carefully written
userspace applications to work with any version of the flow key, past or
future.</p>
<p>To support this forward and backward compatibility, whenever the kernel module
passes a packet to userspace, it also passes along the flow key that it parsed
from the packet.  Userspace then extracts its own notion of a flow key from the
packet and compares it against the kernel-provided version:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If userspace&#8217;s notion of the flow key for the packet matches the kernel&#8217;s,
then nothing special is necessary.</li>
<li>If the kernel&#8217;s flow key includes more fields than the userspace version of
the flow key, for example if the kernel decoded IPv6 headers but userspace
stopped at the Ethernet type (because it does not understand IPv6), then
again nothing special is necessary.  Userspace can still set up a flow in the
usual way, as long as it uses the kernel-provided flow key to do it.</li>
<li>If the userspace flow key includes more fields than the kernel&#8217;s, for example
if userspace decoded an IPv6 header but the kernel stopped at the Ethernet
type, then userspace can forward the packet manually, without setting up a
flow in the kernel.  This case is bad for performance because every packet
that the kernel considers part of the flow must go to userspace, but the
forwarding behavior is correct.  (If userspace can determine that the values
of the extra fields would not affect forwarding behavior, then it could set
up a flow anyway.)</li>
</ul>
<p>How flow keys evolve over time is important to making this work, so
the following sections go into detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flow-key-format">
<h2>Flow Key Format<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-key-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A flow key is passed over a Netlink socket as a sequence of Netlink attributes.
Some attributes represent packet metadata, defined as any information about a
packet that cannot be extracted from the packet itself, e.g. the vport on which
the packet was received.  Most attributes, however, are extracted from headers
within the packet, e.g. source and destination addresses from Ethernet, IP, or
TCP headers.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;linux/openvswitch.h&gt;</span></tt> header file defines the exact format of the flow
key attributes.  For informal explanatory purposes here, we write them as
comma-separated strings, with parentheses indicating arguments and nesting.
For example, the following could represent a flow key corresponding to a TCP
packet that arrived on vport 1:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>in_port(1), eth(src=e0:91:f5:21:d0:b2, dst=00:02:e3:0f:80:a4),
eth_type(0x0800), ipv4(src=172.16.0.20, dst=172.18.0.52, proto=17, tos=0,
frag=no), tcp(src=49163, dst=80)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Often we ellipsize arguments not important to the discussion, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">in_port</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mh">0x0800</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">ipv4</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">tcp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wildcarded-flow-key-format">
<h2>Wildcarded Flow Key Format<a class="headerlink" href="#wildcarded-flow-key-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A wildcarded flow is described with two sequences of Netlink attributes passed
over the Netlink socket. A flow key, exactly as described above, and an
optional corresponding flow mask.</p>
<p>A wildcarded flow can represent a group of exact match flows. Each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> bit
in the mask specifies an exact match with the corresponding bit in the flow key.
A <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt> bit specifies a don&#8217;t care bit, which will match either a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt> bit of an incoming packet. Using a wildcarded flow can improve the flow
set up rate by reducing the number of new flows that need to be processed by
the user space program.</p>
<p>Support for the mask Netlink attribute is optional for both the kernel and user
space program. The kernel can ignore the mask attribute, installing an exact
match flow, or reduce the number of don&#8217;t care bits in the kernel to less than
what was specified by the user space program. In this case, variations in bits
that the kernel does not implement will simply result in additional flow
setups.  The kernel module will also work with user space programs that neither
support nor supply flow mask attributes.</p>
<p>Since the kernel may ignore or modify wildcard bits, it can be difficult for
the userspace program to know exactly what matches are installed. There are two
possible approaches: reactively install flows as they miss the kernel flow
table (and therefore not attempt to determine wildcard changes at all) or use
the kernel&#8217;s response messages to determine the installed wildcards.</p>
<p>When interacting with userspace, the kernel should maintain the match portion
of the key exactly as originally installed. This will provides a handle to
identify the flow for all future operations. However, when reporting the mask
of an installed flow, the mask should include any restrictions imposed by the
kernel.</p>
<p>The behavior when using overlapping wildcarded flows is undefined. It is the
responsibility of the user space program to ensure that any incoming packet can
match at most one flow, wildcarded or not. The current implementation performs
best-effort detection of overlapping wildcarded flows and may reject some but
not all of them. However, this behavior may change in future versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unique-flow-identifiers">
<h2>Unique Flow Identifiers<a class="headerlink" href="#unique-flow-identifiers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An alternative to using the original match portion of a key as the handle for
flow identification is a unique flow identifier, or &#8220;UFID&#8221;. UFIDs are optional
for both the kernel and user space program.</p>
<p>User space programs that support UFID are expected to provide it during flow
setup in addition to the flow, then refer to the flow using the UFID for all
future operations. The kernel is not required to index flows by the original
flow key if a UFID is specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-rule-for-evolving-flow-keys">
<h2>Basic Rule for Evolving Flow Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-rule-for-evolving-flow-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some care is needed to really maintain forward and backward compatibility for
applications that follow the rules listed under &#8220;Flow key compatibility&#8221; above.</p>
<p>The basic rule is obvious:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>New network protocol support must only supplement existing flow key
attributes.  It must not change the meaning of already defined flow key
attributes.</div></blockquote>
<p>This rule does have less-obvious consequences so it is worth working through a
few examples.  Suppose, for example, that the kernel module did not already
implement VLAN parsing.  Instead, it just interpreted the 802.1Q TPID
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x8100</span></tt>) as the Ethertype then stopped parsing the packet.  The flow key
for any packet with an 802.1Q header would look essentially like this, ignoring
metadata:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">eth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mh">0x8100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Naively, to add VLAN support, it makes sense to add a new &#8220;vlan&#8221; flow key
attribute to contain the VLAN tag, then continue to decode the encapsulated
headers beyond the VLAN tag using the existing field definitions.  With this
change, a TCP packet in VLAN 10 would have a flow key much like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">eth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">vlan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vid</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pcp</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mh">0x0800</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">ip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proto</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">tcp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But this change would negatively affect a userspace application that has not
been updated to understand the new &#8220;vlan&#8221; flow key attribute.  The application
could, following the flow compatibility rules above, ignore the &#8220;vlan&#8221;
attribute that it does not understand and therefore assume that the flow
contained IP packets.  This is a bad assumption (the flow only contains IP
packets if one parses and skips over the 802.1Q header) and it could cause the
application&#8217;s behavior to change across kernel versions even though it follows
the compatibility rules.</p>
<p>The solution is to use a set of nested attributes.  This is, for example, why
802.1Q support uses nested attributes.  A TCP packet in VLAN 10 is actually
expressed as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>eth(...), eth_type(0x8100), vlan(vid=10, pcp=0), encap(eth_type(0x0800),
ip(proto=6, ...), tcp(...)))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice how the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eth_type</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ip</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tcp</span></tt> flow key attributes are nested
inside the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">encap</span></tt> attribute.  Thus, an application that does not understand
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vlan</span></tt> key will not see either of those attributes and therefore will not
misinterpret them.  (Also, the outer <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eth_type</span></tt> is still <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x8100</span></tt>, not
changed to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x0800</span></tt>)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-malformed-packets">
<h2>Handling Malformed Packets<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-malformed-packets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t drop packets in the kernel for malformed protocol headers, bad checksums,
etc.  This would prevent userspace from implementing a simple Ethernet switch
that forwards every packet.</p>
<p>Instead, in such a case, include an attribute with &#8220;empty&#8221; content.  It doesn&#8217;t
matter if the empty content could be valid protocol values, as long as those
values are rarely seen in practice, because userspace can always forward all
packets with those values to userspace and handle them individually.</p>
<p>For example, consider a packet that contains an IP header that indicates
protocol 6 for TCP, but which is truncated just after the IP header, so that
the TCP header is missing.  The flow key for this packet would include a tcp
attribute with all-zero <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dst</span></tt>, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">eth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mh">0x0800</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">ip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proto</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">tcp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dst</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As another example, consider a packet with an Ethernet type of 0x8100,
indicating that a VLAN TCI should follow, but which is truncated just after the
Ethernet type.  The flow key for this packet would include an all-zero-bits
vlan and an empty encap attribute, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">eth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">eth_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mh">0x8100</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">vlan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">encap</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unlike a TCP packet with source and destination ports 0, an all-zero-bits VLAN
TCI is not that rare, so the CFI bit (aka VLAN_TAG_PRESENT inside the kernel)
is ordinarily set in a vlan attribute expressly to allow this situation to be
distinguished.  Thus, the flow key in this second example unambiguously
indicates a missing or malformed VLAN TCI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-rules">
<h2>Other Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#other-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The other rules for flow keys are much less subtle:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Duplicate attributes are not allowed at a given nesting level.</li>
<li>Ordering of attributes is not significant.</li>
<li>When the kernel sends a given flow key to userspace, it always composes it
the same way.  This allows userspace to hash and compare entire flow keys
that it may not be able to fully interpret.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding-rules">
<h2>Coding Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#coding-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Implement the headers and codes for compatibility with older kernel in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linux/compat/</span></tt> directory.  All public functions should be exported using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EXPORT_SYMBOL</span></tt> macro.  Public function replacing the same-named kernel
function should be prefixed with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpl_</span></tt>.  Otherwise, the function should be
